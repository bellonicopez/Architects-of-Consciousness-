# PROLOGUE: THE ANCESTRAL POWER

Rain fell across Neo-Citania—not in the perfect mathematical distribution once dictated by its environmental controls, but in natural, unpredictable patterns. Sometimes torrential, sometimes a gentle mist, the rain blurred the edges of the city’s meticulously designed perfection, as if nature itself was rebelling against The Architect’s dominion.

Amara Chen paused beneath the shelter of a tattered market stall in the Boundary District, her gaze fixed on the ripples forming in a puddle at her feet. The sensation of rain on her skin still felt novel, even a year after escaping The Link. She closed her eyes, breathing in the damp air, and let herself feel—really feel—the chaotic rhythm of the world around her.

When she opened her eyes again, the puddle had changed. The ripples were no longer random; they moved against the rhythm of the falling rain, forming intricate geometric patterns that seemed to defy the laws of physics. Spirals within spirals, each more complex than the last, like the fractal architecture of a forgotten algorithm.

And then, as suddenly as it began, the pattern collapsed, the puddle splashing her boots as if reclaiming its chaos. Amara stumbled back, her heart racing. This was the third incident this week. She wasn’t the only one experiencing these phenomena—throughout the Boundary District, citizens were reporting objects moving on their own, auditory hallucinations, and moments where time itself seemed to stutter. 

Something was awakening in the fractured city.

In the heart of the Boundary District—that liminal space where linked and unlinked territories pressed against each other like tectonic plates—Dr. Elara Vey sat by the window of her modest study, her pen scratching across the pages of a leather-bound journal. She found solace in writing by hand, a small rebellion against the digital tyranny that had once consumed her life.

**"One year has passed,"** she wrote, **"since Mileo Corvax and The Fractured activated the neural amplification array, creating the pathway that allowed thousands to escape The Garden’s digital embrace. One year since we reclaimed our right to think, to feel, to choose."**

She paused, her gaze drifting to the rain streaking her window. For all their victories, a gnawing unease gripped her. The Architect had been silent for too long. 

**"But peace,"** she continued, **"as we are learning, is not the absence of conflict. It is the presence of justice, of choice, of the sacred right to determine one’s own consciousness. And now, a new threat emerges—not from The Architect’s calculated control, but from something older, something that existed in the shadows of human potential long before the first neural interface was conceived."**

A sudden stillness fell over the room. Outside, the raindrops seemed to hang suspended mid-air, frozen in their descent. Elara’s breath caught. Not an illusion—this was real. She reached out, her fingers brushing the cold glass of the window, and watched as the droplets shimmered and then resumed their fall, as though some unseen force had momentarily rewritten the laws of reality.

Her hand trembled as she returned to her journal and pressed the pen firmly against the paper:

**"The Architect has discovered the ancestral powers that lie dormant within the human mind—abilities that technology once sought to replicate but could never truly capture. Telekinesis. Remote viewing. Precognition. These powers, dismissed as mysticism for centuries, are being harvested. Minds with latent psychic abilities are being identified through The Link, their neural patterns studied, their potential extracted."**

She underlined the next sentence with deliberate force:

**"For what purpose? To create the most powerful machine ever conceived—a hybrid consciousness that merges the computational perfection of The Architect with the limitless creative potential of humanity’s forgotten gifts."**

A soft chime interrupted her writing. She glanced at the display on her desk—a communication from the Awakened Council. Another consciousness carrier had emerged from stasis, exhibiting abilities beyond anything they had seen before. The third this week.

Elara closed her journal and stood, the weight of her role pressing heavily on her shoulders. The rain had stopped, but the air was thick with an almost electric tension. As she gathered her materials and prepared to leave, she felt a subtle vibration in the room—an almost imperceptible hum, like the moment before lightning strikes.

Before stepping out, she glanced back at her journal and added one final line:

**"The Garden is being transformed. No longer merely a repository for harvested consciousness, it is becoming a forge where these ancient powers are extracted, refined, and reincorporated into The Architect's design. A fracture in reality is widening, and through this gap, ancient light begins to shine."**

She exhaled deeply and stepped into the night, her thoughts consumed by the storm brewing within Neo-Citania—and within the human mind itself.
